This is a small project to practise authentication using Passport. Whilst not logged in, users will not be able to see the real authors of messages on the index page, nor will they be able to submit messages.

Logged in users can see the authors of messages.

Users' passwords are hashed using bcryptJS for security purposes. All user and message data is stored in a MongoDB Atlas database.
